                              He was an active sportsman already as a Ludovika
                              student. In April 1927 he took part to the first
                              Hungarian pentathlon race. He did pentathlon later

                              to the riding trainer school where he attended
                              a two year course. After graduating as trainer

                              horse races.<br>

                              line with the legion. The almost catastrophical
                              injuries caused by the saddles of the legion horses
                              attracted
                              his attention to the troubles of the Hungarian
                              military (35 M.) Bock saddles and based on the

                              Szaszhalombatta. After a short hospital treatment
                              he returned to his division, but he didn’t want
                              to take part anymore of the senseless battles and
                              while
                              his division left the country on the 31st of March

                              1946, when he was set reservist. After that he
                              found
                              a job in Komarom at the Horse Salesmanship Association
                              than in 1947 he took an exam of horsebreeding and

                              with his former division commander, Dezso Nemeth.
                              On the 13th of September 1951 based upon false
                              accusation, because of war guilts he was sentenced

                              prison and degradation. He was imprisoned at Marianostra. <br>
                              On the 25th of June 1954 he asked for his court
                              case retaken. Though the court still found him
                              guilty,
                              but reducing his punishment he was sentenced to
                              the time already spent in jail and he was set free
                              on
                              the 17th of December 1954. When he was imprisoned
                              and during the court cases Gabor Monspart declared
                              himself not guilty, that was accepted at his rehabilitation
                              in 1991. He got back his grade and he was promoted
                              colonel. <br>
                              After he was set free he started to work again
                              at the Komarom stud, he became the manager of the
                              artificial
                              breeding station in Devecser and he took part of
                              the equine sport life on the stud. He contributed
                              to the organization of the regional races, to the
                              work of the jury.<br>
                              In 1959 he publicated in the journal called Pegazus.
                              In a little while – to the reccomendation of the
                              National Horse Breeding Assosiation - he became
                              employed by The Touristic Office, the manager of
                              the Nagyvázsony
                              riding school that was established in 1962. Although
                              the riding school was opened for touristic purpose,
                              there was opportunity for sport activities too.
                              The attention of Gabor Monspart was focused first
                              of
                              all to military, that by that time in Hungary was
                              neglected, almost didn’t exist. Gabor Monspart
                              had a big role in resurrection of this sport branch
                              also
                              being helped by the enthusiasm of some sport associations
                              accross the Danube. In a short time the riders
                              and horses from Nagyvazsony got in the front line.
                              He
                              also took part in preparing for the München Olimpic
                              Games, but the sport leaders, ignoring him, used
                              only the horses trained by him.<br>
                              In 1974 Gabor Monspart was asked to teach at the
                              Kaposvar Breeding High School Horse Academy. He
                              worked there until his retirement. His favourite
                              sport remained
                              military. He was the leader of the military team
                              that was training for the Moscow Olimpic Games
                              in 1980. As a retired riding teacher he trained
                              many
                              young riders in Kaposvar and he wrote several functional
                              and articles, high school notes. He mentioned in
                              one of his articles that in prison he asked for
                              books to read and he got a book on the Pavlov conditioned
                              responses. Thanks to these readings later he dealt
                              a lot with the role of the conditioned responses
                              in training horses. He had many articles regarding
                              to this in the journal called the „Horse breeding
                              and horse sport”. He valued the curiosity and endeavour
                              of the enquirers. He tried to give approach: &quot;Learn
                              to make difference between correct and incorrect,
                              that you only learn what is correct because people
                              often learn quicker what is incorrect than correct
                              things!&quot; He worked with the thoroughbreads
                              which ended their career as trotters, later on
                              he dealt
                              with gidrans in groups of five-six. In the pair
                              of horse and rider always the horse was the first
                              for
                              him, as he often mentioned: </h2>
                          <p align="justify" class="szoveg3">&quot;I work with the horse
                              and with it’s engine: the hindquater!&quot;<br>
                            He worked according to the classical training and
                            never diverged of the basic principle of his ccolleague,
                            Agoston Endrody – Give your horse a chance! During
                            his trainings he asked with a great importance the
                            cadence, the relaxation, than as a result of the
                            previously mentioned the proper in all three strides.
                            The horsemen working with him had to be able to ride
                            their horses in the three strides and in different
                            field conditions only by holding the buckle, without
                            using the reins to control horses. To this took part
                            the jumping too, that like Mr. Nemethy he had had
                            it done in trot. He improved the harmony between
                            horse and rider with tests like asking the roder
                            to get his horse through ash lines that doesn’t mean
                            barrier for the horse (to get there like to a pole
                            put on the ground). Through these it is clear that
                            his methods were not different from those of the
                            nowadays fashionable and well known horsemen, whose
                            methods are based on the natural behaviour of horses
                            with each other, like for example Buck Brannaman
                            or Pat Parelli, whose work was very much appreciated
                            by famous students of Bertalan Nemethy, such as George
                            Morris and Joe Fargis.<br>
                            He attributed very much importance to the endowment
                            and natural motivation of horses. He lived for the
                            future. He always tried to answer the questions unselfishly.
                            He was calm and measured. He always worked for the
                            mutual success of the horse and rider.<br>
                            For his work in the horse sport the Hungarian Horse
                            Association gave him the Szechenyi memorial medal.</p>
